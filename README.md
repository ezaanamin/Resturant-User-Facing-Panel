Restaurant User Panel

This is a web application that provides a user-facing panel for browsing a restaurant's menu, placing orders, and tracking delivery/pickup status. It is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, which allows for efficient and scalable development of modern web applications.
Features

The restaurant user panel includes the following features:

    Menu: A list of all menu items, with details such as name, description, price, and image. The user can filter, sort, or search menu items based on various criteria (e.g. vegetarian, spicy, gluten-free), as well as view nutritional information and allergen warnings.
    Ordering: A simple and intuitive interface for adding menu items to the cart, specifying quantities, and customizing options (e.g. toppings, sauces, drinks). The user can review the order summary, estimate the total cost and time, and apply any discounts or coupons.
    Checkout: A secure and seamless process for entering delivery/pickup details (e.g. address, phone number, special instructions), choosing a payment method (e.g. credit card, PayPal), and confirming the order. The user can also track the progress of the order in real-time, receive notifications and updates, and rate/review the experience.
    Account: A personalized dashboard for managing user profile, order history, and preferences. The user can view and edit their personal information (e.g. name, email, password), access past and current orders, and save favorite menu items or orders for future reference. The user can also earn rewards points or loyalty benefits, refer friends, or share feedback.

Technologies

The restaurant user panel is built using the following technologies:

    MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data related to menu items, orders, users, and transactions.
    Express.js: A Node.js framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests/responses.
    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and components using reusable and composable code.
    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side JavaScript code and handling I/O operations.
    Redux: A state management library for handling complex data flows and interactions between components.
